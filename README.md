## Why FinOps Policy as Code?
Managing cloud costs can be a challenging task, especially in dynamic and complex cloud environments. 
Traditional approaches often rely on manual intervention and periodic audits, which can lead to cost overruns and budgetary surprises. 
FinOps Policy as Code aims to address these challenges by:

Automating cost control measures: Define policies as code to automate actions like resource termination, scaling, and alerts based on cost thresholds.
Ensuring compliance: Enforce financial policies consistently across your cloud resources to minimize cost overruns and maintain financial accountability.
Providing transparency: Gain visibility into your cloud costs and usage trends through automated reporting and monitoring.
Facilitating collaboration: Foster collaboration between finance, operations, and development teams by codifying and versioning financial policies.

# Objectives 
Demonstrate an example for github actions
This is a small yaml file that will run on schedule and inform if there is a config change that we should remediate in our out of band processes
Demonstrate how to Sentinel -Enforce a Policy
This is a companion repository for the Cost Estimation tutorial on HashiCorp Learn. It contains an example Sentinel policy to restrict resource provisioning that would increase costs by more than $100.

# Usage
Once you've set up FinOps Policy as Code and defined your financial policies, you can use it to manage your cloud costs. 
Here are some common usage scenarios:

# Enforce Policy As Code Sentinel policies

# Examples
In the "soma-terraform-cost-estimation" directory of this repository, you will find a sample financial policies and usage scenarios. 
These examples can help you understand how to define and use FinOps Policy as Code effectively.
